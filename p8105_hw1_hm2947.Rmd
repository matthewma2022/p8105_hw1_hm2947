## `r The penguins data set contains equal number of categorical variables as the numerical variables. As I noticed, the year range is about 2 years from 2007 to 2009. The penguins are sourced from three islands named: "Torgersen", "Biscoe" and "Dream" varied by 3 species: "Adelie", "Gentoo", and "Chinstrap". Each penguin's bill length and depth are measured, their body mass and flipper length are also recorded. This data set has got 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper length is 200.9mm which is very close to its median 197, so it should look nearly symmetric. `
